/**
 * Creates a deferred promise along with its resolve and reject functions.
 * This allows for the promise to be resolved or rejected at a later time
 * outside of the promise constructor callback.
 *
 * @template T The type of the value with which the promise will be resolved.
 * @returns An object containing:
 * - `promise`: A Promise<T> that can be awaited or otherwise used.
 * - `resolve`: A function that, when called with a value of type T, resolves the promise.
 * - `reject`: A function that, when called with a reason, rejects the promise.
